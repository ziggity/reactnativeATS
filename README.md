# reactnativeATS

As a recruiter for the last 10 years, building an ATS (applicant tracking system) would be pretty fun and I could bring my insider knowledge to help human resources. The current products on the market are very cost-prohibitive.

This will involve several components, including user authentication, candidate management, job management, and search functionality. Some competitors are Greenhouse (a huge one, that does a lot of things pretty quickly and is cloud-based but very costly), workday (sorta functions ok but does more metrics and dashboards better than actual candidate management tools like Greenhouse), bambooHR, Lever,, workable, iCIMS (ancient one used by amazon, horribly slow, and archaic but has great SQL database to showcase metrics quickly), jobvite, bullhorn (mostly for job posting  and blasting emails out but has changed a lot recently), 

Here's a short game plan to build such a system using React Native: identify which one I want to cover (human resources focused or is it more analytics focused?) I’ll go with the recruiter user experience first, best for them, and add in dashboards later. So fast upload of resumes, quickly tagging to jobs, getting candidate setup with hacker rank test email sent out, @ sign to HM for chatting but can be just a short one-way message doesn’t need web sockets to keep an open dialogue.
